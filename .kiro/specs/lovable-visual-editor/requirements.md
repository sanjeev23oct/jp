# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the HTML Prototype Builder into a comprehensive Lovable.dev-like platform specifically optimized for creating HTML5 applications with advanced visual editing and surgical code modifications. The platform will enable users to build production-quality HTML5 apps through a combination of AI-powered generation, intuitive visual editing, and precise surgical code edits - all without requiring deep coding knowledge.

The key differentiator from the current implementation is the focus on making visual editing and surgical edits the primary workflow, with AI generation as the starting point. Users should be able to click, drag, edit, and refine their HTML5 apps visually, with the system intelligently applying surgical edits to the underlying code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Visual Editing System

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want to visually edit any element in my HTML5 app by clicking on it, so that I can make changes without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any element in the preview THEN the system SHALL highlight the element with a visual indicator and display its editable properties in a panel
2. WHEN a user hovers over elements in the preview THEN the system SHALL show a subtle outline and display the element's tag name and classes
3. WHEN a user edits text content in the property panel THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time without page reload
4. WHEN a user changes style properties (color, size, spacing, etc.) THEN the system SHALL apply changes instantly with visual feedback
5. WHEN a user saves visual edits THEN the system SHALL apply surgical edits to the underlying HTML/CSS code to persist changes
6. IF a user makes multiple edits THEN the system SHALL batch them and apply all changes atomically
7. WHEN a user selects a parent element THEN the system SHALL show a breadcrumb trail of the element hierarchy
8. WHEN a user wants to edit nested elements THEN the system SHALL provide a tree view for precise selection

### Requirement 2: Drag-and-Drop Component System

**User Story:** As a user building an HTML5 app, I want to drag and drop pre-built components onto my page, so that I can quickly assemble interfaces without starting from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the component palette THEN the system SHALL display categorized HTML5 components (navigation, forms, cards, modals, etc.)
2. WHEN a user drags a component from the palette THEN the system SHALL show a ghost preview of where it will be placed
