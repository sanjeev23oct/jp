# Requirements Document - EARS Requirements Mode

## Introduction

This feature adds a Business Analyst (BA) mode to the application that allows users to generate requirements in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) notation. EARS is a structured approach to writing clear, unambiguous requirements using five specific patterns. This mode will transform the tool from a prototype builder into a requirements documentation tool for BAs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mode Switcher

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between "Prototype Mode" and "BA Mode", so that I can use the tool for different purposes (building prototypes vs. writing requirements).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a mode switcher in the header
2. WHEN the user clicks the mode switcher THEN the system SHALL toggle between "Prototype Mode" and "BA Mode"
3. WHEN the user switches to BA Mode THEN the system SHALL change the UI to show a requirements editor instead of HTML/CSS/JS preview
4. WHEN the user switches to Prototype Mode THEN the system SHALL restore the original prototype builder interface
5. WHEN the user switches modes THEN the system SHALL persist the selected mode in localStorage
6. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL restore the previously selected mode

### Requirement 2: BA Mode Interface

**User Story:** As a BA, I want a dedicated interface for writing requirements, so that I can focus on requirements documentation without prototype-related distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BA Mode is active THEN the system SHALL display a requirements editor on the right side
2. WHEN BA Mode is active THEN the system SHALL hide the HTML/CSS/JS preview panel
3. WHEN BA Mode is active THEN the system SHALL show a markdown preview of the requirements document
4. WHEN BA Mode is active THEN the system SHALL display EARS pattern templates in a sidebar
5. WHEN BA Mode is active THEN the system SHALL change the chat placeholder to "Describe your feature or requirement..."
6. WHEN BA Mode is active THEN the system SHALL update the project name to indicate it's a requirements document

### Requirement 3: EARS Pattern Generation

**User Story:** As a BA, I want the AI to generate requirements in EARS notation, so that I can create clear, structured requirements following industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user describes a feature in BA Mode THEN the system SHALL generate requirements using EARS patterns
2. WHEN generating requirements THEN the system SHALL use the Ubiquitous pattern for general system behaviors ("The system SHALL...")
3. WHEN generating requirements THEN the system SHALL use the Event-driven pattern for trigger-based behaviors ("WHEN [trigger] the system SHALL...")
4. WHEN generating requirements THEN the system SHALL use the State-driven pattern for conditional behaviors ("WHILE [state] the system SHALL...")
5. WHEN generating requirements THEN the system SHALL use the Unwanted behavior pattern for error handling ("IF [condition] THEN the system SHALL...")
6. WHEN generating requirements THEN the system SHALL use the Optional pattern for feature-specific behaviors ("WHERE [feature] the system SHALL...")
7. WHEN generating requirements THEN the system SHALL organize them by functional area or user story

### Requirement 4: Requirements Document Structure

**User Story:** As a BA, I want requirements organized in a clear structure, so that stakeholders can easily understand and review them.

3. WHEN requirements are generated THEN the system SHALL number each requirement sequentially
4. WHEN requirements are generated THEN the system SHALL include user stories for each functional area
5. WHEN requirements are generated THEN the system SHALL format the document in markdown
6. WHEN requirements are generated THEN the system SHALL include a table of contents for documents with more than 5 requirements

### Requirement 5: EARS Pattern Templates

**User Story:** As a BA, I want quick access to EARS pattern templates, so that I can manually write requirements following the correct format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BA Mode is active THEN the system SHALL display a templates panel with all 5 EARS patterns
2. WHEN the user clicks a template THEN the system SHALL insert the pattern template at the cursor position
3. WHEN displaying templates THEN the system SHALL show examples for each pattern
4. WHEN displaying templates THEN the system SHALL include a brief description of when to use each pattern
5. WHEN the user hovers over a template THEN the system SHALL highlight the pattern structure

### Requirement 6: Requirements Editing

**User Story:** As a BA, I want to edit generated requirements, so that I can refine them to match specific project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in an editable markdown editor
2. WHEN the user edits requirements THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time
3. WHEN the user edits requirements THEN the system SHALL auto-save changes every 2 seconds
4. WHEN the user edits requirements THEN the system SHALL maintain EARS pattern syntax highlighting
5. WHEN the user types "WHEN", "WHILE", "IF", "WHERE", or "SHALL" THEN the system SHALL highlight these keywords

### Requirement 7: Export Requirements

**User Story:** As a BA, I want to export requirements in multiple formats, so that I can share them with stakeholders and development teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks export in BA Mode THEN the system SHALL offer export options (Markdown, PDF, Word, HTML)
2. WHEN the user exports as Markdown THEN the system SHALL download a .md file with the requirements
3. WHEN the user exports as PDF THEN the system SHALL generate a formatted PDF document
4. WHEN the user exports as Word THEN the system SHALL generate a .docx file
5. WHEN the user exports as HTML THEN the system SHALL generate a standalone HTML file
6. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include project metadata (name, date, version)

### Requirement 8: Requirements Validation

**User Story:** As a BA, I want the system to validate my requirements, so that I can ensure they follow EARS patterns correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests validation THEN the system SHALL check each requirement against EARS patterns
2. WHEN a requirement doesn't follow EARS patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight it with a warning
3. WHEN a requirement is missing "SHALL" THEN the system SHALL suggest adding it
4. WHEN a requirement is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL flag it for review
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL show a summary of issues found
6. WHEN the user clicks a validation warning THEN the system SHALL jump to that requirement

### Requirement 9: AI-Assisted Refinement

**User Story:** As a BA, I want the AI to help refine my requirements, so that I can improve clarity and completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a requirement and clicks "Refine" THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements
2. WHEN refining THEN the system SHALL identify missing conditions or edge cases
3. WHEN refining THEN the system SHALL suggest more specific language
4. WHEN refining THEN the system SHALL check for consistency with other requirements
5. WHEN refinement suggestions are shown THEN the system SHALL allow the user to accept or reject each suggestion

### Requirement 10: Requirements Versioning

**User Story:** As a BA, I want to track versions of my requirements document, so that I can see how requirements evolved over time.
