# Session Context Summary
**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Bug Fixes, History System Implementation, and Optimization

---

## 🎯 Session Overview

This session focused on implementing the undo/redo history system (Tasks 1-4 from the Lovable Visual Editor spec) and fixing critical bugs related to visual editing, undo/redo functionality, chart data visualization, and timeout issues for bigger apps.

---

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### 1. **History System Implementation** ✅ (Tasks 1-4 Completed)

#### Task 1: History Store and Command Pattern Infrastructure ✅
**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/store/useHistoryStore.ts` - Zustand store for undo/redo management
- `frontend/src/types/history.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for command pattern
- `frontend/src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)

**Features:**
- Command pattern implementation
- Undo/redo stacks with 50-entry limit
- Automatic stack size management
- Keyboard shortcuts for undo/redo

#### Task 2: History Command Classes ✅
**File Created:**
- `frontend/src/lib/commands.ts` - Command implementations

**Command Types Implemented:**
1. `VisualEditCommand` - Tracks visual editor changes
2. `SurgicalEditCommand` - Tracks surgical edit changes
3. `AgentGenerationCommand` - Tracks AI-generated code
4. `ComponentInsertionCommand` - Tracks component additions

**Architecture:**
- Each command stores before/after snapshots
- Commands implement execute(), undo(), redo() methods
- Helper functions: createSnapshot(), applySnapshot()

#### Task 3: Integration with Existing Features ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useVisualEditor.ts` - Integrated history tracking
- `frontend/src/hooks/useSurgicalEdit.ts` - Integrated history tracking
- `frontend/src/store/useChatStore.ts` - Integrated history tracking for agent mode

**Integration Points:**
- Visual editor: Adds command when "Save Changes to Code" is clicked
- Surgical edits: Adds command after successful edit
- Agent generation: Adds command after code generation

#### Task 4: History Timeline UI Component ✅
**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/components/HistoryTimeline.tsx` - Timeline component
- `frontend/src/components/HistoryTimeline.css` - Dark theme styling

**Features:**
- Scrollable list of all history items
- Command type icons (🎨 visual, ✂️ surgical, 🤖 agent, ➕ add, 🗑️ delete)
- Relative timestamps ("2 minutes ago")
- **Click-to-jump functionality** - Click any history item to jump to that point
- Search/filter capability
- Clear history button with confirmation
- Stats display (undo stack size, redo stack size)

**Integration:**
- Added to `LivePreview.tsx` toolbar
- Button shows history count: "📜 {count}"
- Opens as modal overlay

---

### 2. **Critical Bug Fixes** ✅

#### Bug #1: Undo/Redo Preview Disappearing
**Problem:** When undo/redo was executed, the preview would disappear.

**Root Cause:** `addCommand()` in `useHistoryStore.ts` was calling `command.execute()`, which re-applied the snapshot even though changes were already applied.

**Fix:** Removed the `command.execute()` call from `addCommand()`. Commands are now only stored for undo/redo, not executed when added.

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/store/useHistoryStore.ts`

#### Bug #2: Visual Editing Screen Flicker
**Problem:** When changing text in visual edit mode, the screen would flicker.

**Root Cause:** Text content changes were triggering HTML updates via `updateHtml()`, which reloaded the iframe.

**Fix:** Modified `updateElement()` to apply all changes (text, className, id, styles) directly to the DOM without triggering HTML updates. Changes are only saved when user clicks "Save Changes to Code".

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/hooks/useVisualEditor.ts`

#### Bug #3: Color Changes Not Reflected
**Problem:** Color changes in visual edit mode weren't visible.

**Root Cause:** Same as Bug #2 - iframe was being reloaded, losing inline style changes.

**Fix:** Same as Bug #2 - all style changes are now applied as inline styles and persist until saved.

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/hooks/useVisualEditor.ts`

#### Bug #4: Todo App Add Button Not Working
**Problem:** Generated todo apps had non-functional Add buttons. Data wasn't persisting to localStorage.

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Enhanced agent mode prompt to emphasize functional requirements
2. Added `allow-forms` to iframe sandbox attribute
3. Required explicit UI update calls after data operations

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/llm/prompts/agent-mode.ts` - Enhanced prompt
- `frontend/src/components/editor/LivePreview.tsx` - Added allow-forms

**New Prompt Requirements:**
- ALL buttons MUST have working click handlers
- After ANY data operation, MUST call updateUI() or renderChart()
- Create master updateUI() function that refreshes everything
- Pre-populate with 5-10 sample data items
- Verify: Clicking "Add" button MUST show item immediately

#### Bug #5: Chart Data Not Displaying
**Problem:** "Generate Sample Data" button created data but charts remained empty.

**Root Cause:** Generated code created data but didn't call the render function to update the UI.

**Fix:** Enhanced agent mode prompt with explicit chart requirements:
- MUST have renderChart() function
- MUST call renderChart() after data operations
- MUST call updateUI() after generateSampleData()
- Charts MUST update immediately when data changes

**File Modified:** `backend/src/llm/prompts/agent-mode.ts`

#### Bug #6: Timeout Issues for Bigger Apps
**Problem:** Complex apps were timing out before generation completed.

**Fix:** Increased LLM timeouts:
- Non-streaming: 180s (3 min) → 600s (10 min)
- Streaming: 300s (5 min) → 600s (10 min)

**Additional Optimization:**
- Added guidance to keep code concise for complex apps
- Focus on core functionality first
- Avoid redundant code
- Use efficient patterns

**File Modified:** `backend/src/llm/providers/deepseek.ts`

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Command Pattern for Undo/Redo
**Decision:** Use command pattern with before/after snapshots

**Rationale:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to add new command types
- Supports complex undo/redo scenarios
- Can be extended for branching history

### 2. Don't Execute Commands on Add
**Decision:** `addCommand()` only stores commands, doesn't execute them

**Rationale:**
- Changes are already applied when command is created
- Executing again would duplicate the change
- Prevents preview from disappearing on undo/redo

### 3. Visual Editing: Apply Changes Directly to DOM
**Decision:** Apply all visual edits as inline styles without HTML updates

**Rationale:**
- Prevents iframe reload and flicker
- Provides instant visual feedback
- Changes are saved in batch when user clicks "Save Changes"
- Better UX for iterative editing

### 4. Increased Timeouts to 10 Minutes
**Decision:** Increased from 3/5 minutes to 10 minutes

**Rationale:**
- Complex apps need more generation time
- 10 minutes is reasonable for even large prototypes
- Better than failing and requiring regeneration
- Users can see progress via streaming

### 5. Master updateUI() Function Pattern
**Decision:** Require a single updateUI() function that refreshes everything

**Rationale:**
- Ensures UI stays in sync with data
- Single source of truth for rendering
- Easy to call after any data operation
- Prevents "data created but not displayed" bugs

## 🧠 Technical Insights

### 1. Iframe Event Handling
- Must wait for iframe `load` event before setting up listeners
- Element references become invalid after iframe reload
- Solution: Don't reload iframe for style-only changes

### 2. Command Pattern Implementation
- Commands should NOT be executed when added to history
- Store before/after snapshots, not just deltas
- Limit stack size to prevent memory issues (50 entries)

### 3. Visual Editing Architecture
Two-phase approach:
1. **Edit Phase**: Changes applied directly to iframe DOM
2. **Save Phase**: Extract HTML and update editor store

### 4. LLM Prompt Engineering for Functionality
Key requirements for functional prototypes:
- Explicit "MUST" statements for critical features
- Verification requirements ("VERIFY: clicking Add button MUST...")
- Master update function pattern
- Pre-populated sample data
- Real-time UI updates

### 5. Timeout Considerations
- Streaming allows longer operations without appearing frozen
- 10 minutes is sufficient for complex apps
- Users can see progress via SSE events
- Frontend fetch has no explicit timeout (uses browser default)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Issue: 404 on /api/chat/stream
**Status:** Reported but not fixed in this session

**Likely Cause:** Backend server needs restart after timeout changes

**Solution:**
1. Stop backend server (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. Wait for "Server started on port 3001"
4. Try again

**Note:** This is documented in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## 📝 Important Notes

### 1. Visual Editing Behavior
- Changes are applied as inline styles
- Changes persist in iframe until "Save Changes to Code" is clicked
- This is intentional to prevent flicker
- For production, inline styles should be extracted to CSS classes

### 2. Undo/Redo Limitations
- Limited to 50 entries to maintain performance
- Older entries are automatically removed
- No branching history (linear undo/redo only)
- History is not persisted across page refreshes

### 3. Agent Mode Prompt
- Very detailed and explicit about functional requirements
- Emphasizes working functionality over dummy code
- Requires pre-populated sample data
- Requires master updateUI() function
- May need further refinement based on user feedback

### 4. Timeout Settings
- 10 minutes should be sufficient for most apps
- If still timing out, suggest breaking down the request
- Surgical edits are faster than full regeneration
- Streaming provides progress feedback

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Diff Preview** (Tasks 6-9) - Show changes before applying
2. **Edit Templates** (Tasks 10-15) - Common patterns like "make responsive"
3. **Component Library** (Tasks 16-23) - Drag-and-drop pre-built components
4. **Persistent History** - Save history to IndexedDB
5. **Branching History** - Support for non-linear undo/redo
6. **Better Error Handling** - More user-friendly error messages
7. **Code Quality Validation** - Check generated code before saving
8. **Performance Optimization** - Virtual scrolling, code splitting
9. **Collaborative Editing** - Real-time collaboration features
10. **Export Improvements** - Better export formats and options

### Technical Debt:
1. Visual editing uses inline styles (should extract to CSS classes)
2. No undo stack persistence (lost on page refresh)
3. Large files still hit token limits
4. SEARCH/REPLACE is whitespace sensitive
5. No conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
