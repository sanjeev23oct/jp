# Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Just Implemented

### 1. **Planning Phase (Like Lovable.dev)**
Before generating code, the AI now:
- Analyzes your request
- Shows an implementation plan with:
  - Understanding of what you want
  - Components to build
  - Key features
  - Data model (if applicable)
  - Tech stack
  - Complexity estimate
- Then generates the code

### 2. **Improved Prompts for Fully Functional Apps**
Updated prompts to ensure:
- **ALL buttons work** - Every button has a click handler
- **ALL forms work** - Every form has a submit handler
- **IndexedDB integration** - For data-driven apps (todos, notes, CRM, etc.)
- **Sample data** - 5-10 realistic items pre-populated
- **CRUD operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete all working
- **Data persistence** - Saves to IndexedDB, survives page refresh
- **Real-time updates** - UI updates immediately when data changes

### 3. **Code Viewer**
Added a "üíª View Code" button that shows:
- Tabbed interface (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)
- Line count and character count
- Copy to clipboard button
- Download as HTML file
- Syntax highlighting (dark theme)
- Keyboard shortcut (ESC to close)

### 4. **Detailed Implementation Summary**
After generation, shows:
- What was implemented
- Key features included
- Next steps & suggestions
- Tips for using the prototype

### 5. **Default to Real Mode**
Changed default from Mock Mode to Real Mode so you get actual LLM responses

## üéØ How to Use

### Generate a CRM Dashboard:
1. Refresh the page
2. Make sure you're in **üöÄ Real Mode** (should be default now)
3. Type: "create a CRM dashboard"
4. Watch the AI:
   - Show the implementation plan
   - Generate the code
   - Show implementation summary
5. Click **üíª View Code** to see the generated code
6. The preview shows the working dashboard

### Expected Output for "CRM Dashboard":
**Plan Phase:**
```
