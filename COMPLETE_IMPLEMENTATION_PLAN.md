# Complete Implementation Plan - Lovable.dev Clone

## Current Issues to Fix

### 1. Agent Mode Not Returning Valid JSON
**Problem**: LLM returns HTML directly instead of JSON structure
**Solution**: Improve prompt to force JSON output, add better parsing with multiple fallback strategies

### 2. UI Doesn't Match Lovable.dev
**Missing Features**:
- Resizable panels (chat/preview split)
- Proper Lovable.dev styling
- Loading states
- Error messages
- Code editor view
- Tabs for different views

### 3. No Automated Testing
**Need**: Playwright tests that actually run the UI and verify functionality

### 4. No Evidence of Working Prototype
**Need**: Save generated HTML to files as proof
